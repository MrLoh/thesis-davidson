  This article argues that questions arising from the Turing Test [@Turing:1950cm] provide a unique perspective for understanding Davidson's philosophy. It focuses on Davidson's discussion in his essay 'Turing's Test' [-@Davidson:1990tt] and points out some similarities between Turing's interest in Machine Learning and Davidson's critique. Furthermore, it argues that the modified version of Turing's Test which Davidson proposes in this essay, provides an operational definition of intelligence which reflects Davidson's Unified Theory of intellectucal and linguistic competence. Along the lines of the two relatively overlooked Davidson essays 'Representation and Interpretation' [-@Davidson:1990ri] and 'What Thought Requires' [-@Davidson:2001wt], it is reconstructed how Davidson takes questions arising from the Turing Test to provide instructive explanations of his view on the relation between the mental and the physical and his triangular Epistemology. It is shown how Davidson's interpretationism and externalism, which respectively results from these views, come together in his theory of interpretation and are clearly expressed as interdependent concepts in Davidson's modified Turing Test. The discusssion concludes with a brief outlook of how Davidson's ideas relate to the debate between Representationists and Connectionists in the prominent Computational Theory of Mind and which impulses it might provide for Computational Linguistics that would deserve further investigation.
